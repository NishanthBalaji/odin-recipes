            Marinate the Mutton: In a bowl, combine mutton pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and spices. Let it
            marinate for at least an hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the Rice: In a large pot, parboil the basmati rice with whole spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and
            cloves.
            Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the Mutton: In a large skillet, heat oil and fry onions until golden brown. Add tomatoes and the
            marinated
            mutton, cooking until the mutton is tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Layer the Biryani: In a heavy-bottomed pot, layer the cooked mutton and parboiled rice. Top with saffron
            milk,
            fried onions, and fresh coriander and mint leaves.

        <li>
            Dum Cooking: Seal the pot with a tight-fitting lid or dough, and cook on low heat for about 20-30 minutes to
            let
            the flavors meld together. Serve hot.
