        Parotta is a popular South Indian flatbread made from maida (refined flour), which is layered and then rolled
        out
        before being shallow fried. It is a staple dish in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, often served with side dishes like
        chicken
        curry, mutton curry, or vegetable kurma.
    </p>
    <p>
        The flaky and crispy texture of parotta makes it a favorite street food and a beloved accompaniment to various
        curries and gravies.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the Dough: In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour (maida) with water and salt to form a smooth
            and
            pliable dough. Let it rest for about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide and Roll: Divide the dough into small balls. Take one ball and roll it out into a thin circle. Apply
            oil
            or ghee on the surface and fold it into pleats. Roll the pleated dough into a spiral and tuck the end
            underneath.
        </li>
        <li>
            Flatten and Fry: Take the rolled dough and flatten it gently with your palm. Heat a skillet or griddle and
            place
            the flattened dough on it. Cook on medium heat, flipping occasionally, until both sides are golden brown and
            crispy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve Hot: Remove the parotta from the skillet and serve hot with your favorite side dish or curry.
        </li>
